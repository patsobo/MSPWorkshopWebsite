# A Simple Website

A template for making a simple website using Jade, Stylus, and Express.  Modified from [this repository](https://github.com/node-crash-course/jade-templating).

### Some useful links

[Here](https://www.visualstudio.com/features/node-js-vs) is the link to download Node.js tools for Visual Studio.

[Here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft_student_developer_blog/2015/07/20/welcome-to-visual-studio-2015-with-azure/) is the link to publish the website on Azure.

### And that's about it... 

Again, big thanks to the Node crash course guys for creating this project.
